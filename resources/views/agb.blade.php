            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">1. Scope of Application</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                These Terms and Conditions apply to all orders placed through the webshop of our supermarket.
                Deviating conditions from the customer will not be accepted unless we explicitly agree to them.
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">2. Contractual Partner, Conclusion of Contract</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                The purchase contract is concluded with IBSupermarkt.
                By clicking the order button, you submit a binding order for the items in your shopping cart.
                Confirmation of the order receipt will be sent via email. The contract is only concluded
                when we send a separate order confirmation or when the goods are delivered.
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">3. Prices and Payment</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                All prices are stated in Euros and include the statutory value-added tax (VAT).
                Payment can be made via credit card, PayPal, or instant bank transfer.
                We reserve the right to exclude certain payment methods.

                within the delivery area specified in the webshop.
                Delivery times may vary depending on the availability of the goods.
                If an item is unavailable, we will promptly inform the customer.
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">5. Right of Withdrawal</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Consumers have the statutory right of withdrawal within 14 days.
                Exceptions to this right include perishable goods and sealed food items,
                which cannot be returned for hygiene reasons.
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">6. Warranty and Liability</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                The statutory warranty rights apply. Our liability is limited to intent and gross negligence,
                as far as permitted by law.
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">7. Data Protection</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Your personal data will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy and will not be shared with unauthorized third parties.
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">8. Final Provisions</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is invalid,
                the validity of the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected.
