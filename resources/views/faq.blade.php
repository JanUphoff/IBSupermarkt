            <h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQ</h2>
            <h5 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 50px;">We have the answers (most of the time)</h5>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">1. How does IBSupermarkt work?</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                It's simple: browse through our shop, fill your cart with everything your heart (or stomach) desires, pay online
                – and we deliver it straight to your door. No more standing in line, no more carrying heavy bags,
                and no more excuses for an empty fridge!
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">2. How fast is the delivery?</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Faster than you can say, “I still have enough food… oh no, maybe not!”
                Okay, maybe not *that* fast, but we do our best to get your order to you as quickly as possible!
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">3. Is there a minimum order value?  </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Yes, but don’t worry – with a few snacks, a coffee supply, and maybe a pack of pasta, you’ll quickly hit the minimum!
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">4. What if an item is unavailable?  </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                We do our best to keep everything in stock. If something is missing, we’ll let you know. No ninja substitutions without your approval!
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">5. Can I change my order after it's been placed?</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Unfortunately, we can’t modify your order after it's been placed – our team starts packing your items right away.
                If you remember something else, just place a new order!
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">6. What payment methods are available?</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                We accept all common payment methods – from credit cards to PayPal. Unfortunately, IOUs or "I’ll pay next time" don’t count.
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">7. I have a problem with my order – what should I do now?</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                No stress! Just send us a message, and we'll take care of it. We’re friendly, promise!
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">8. Do you deliver in the middle of the night?</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Unfortunately, not at the moment – our delivery drivers need sleep (and coffee) too. But we’re working on it!
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 50px;">
                Got any questions? Just write to us! We’re happy to help – as long as it’s not about math homework.
            </p>
